    - NetGAN is able to generate graphs that capture important topological properties of complex
        networks, such as community structure and degree distribution, without having to manually specify any of them.
        Moreover, our proposed model shows strong generalization
        properties, as highlighted by its competitive link prediction
        performance on a number of datasets. NetGAN can also
        be used for generating graphs with continuously varying
        characteristics using latent space interpolation. Combined
        our results provide strong evidence that implicit generative
        models for graphs are well-suited for capturing the complex
        nature of real-world networks.
